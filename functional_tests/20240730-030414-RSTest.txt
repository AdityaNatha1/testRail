Functional Test Cases:

1. Define new routes excluding datapoints call:
   - Input: Define new routes
   - Expected output: New routes handle request/response objects, datapoints call is not included

2. Investigate RMS crashes occurring on the 9th of each month:
   - Input: Simulate RMS crashes on the 9th of each month
   - Expected output: The underlying issue should be identified and a solution should be proposed

3. Enforce co-requisite configuration in Data Access API:
   - Input: Make a data API request
   - Expected output: The system should check for co-requisite compatibility and throw an error if the configuration does not pass

4. Fix issues with audit endpoints:
   - Input: Access the audit endpoints
   - Expected output: The issues with audit endpoints should be resolved and the endpoints should function correctly

5. Ensure reports reflect timezone based on program settings:
   - Input: Generate a report
   - Expected output: The correct timezone should be applied and the data should be accurate

6. Restrict report delivery to non-corporate email addresses:
   - Input: Deliver a report
   - Expected output: The report should not be sent to non-corporate email domains and should only go to approved email addresses

7. Filter audit endpoints by report type ID:
   - Input: Apply a filter by report type ID
   - Expected output: The audit results should be filtered accordingly and only relevant data should be displayed


Non-Functional Test Cases:

1. Performance Test:
   - Input: Simultaneous multiple requests to the new routes and audit endpoints
   - Expected output: The system should handle multiple requests without crashing and within acceptable response time

2. Security Test:
   - Input: Attempt unauthorized access to audit endpoints
   - Expected output: Unauthorized access should be denied

3. Load Test:
   - Input: Increase the number of requests gradually until the maximum limit
   - Expected output: The system should handle the increased load without crashing or slowing down significantly

4. Stress Test:
   - Input: Exceed the number of maximum requests
   - Expected Output: The system should handle the stress and recover from crashes if they occur

5. Usability Test:
   - Input: User interaction with the system
   - Expected Output: The system should be easy to use and intuitive

6. Compatibility Test:
   - Input: Access the system using different devices and browsers
   - Expected Output: The system should be compatible with different devices and browsers

7. Reliability Test:
   - Input: Continuous operation of the system
   - Expected Output: The system should operate without critical failures for a specified period of time
