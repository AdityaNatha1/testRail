Modified Test Cases:

Functional Test Cases:

1. Define new routes excluding datapoints call:
   - Test Case: Add new routes
   - Input: New routes excluding datapoints call
   - Expected output: System should successfully define new routes, datapoints call should not be included

2. Investigate RMS crashes occurring on the 9th of each month:
   - Test Case: Simulate RMS crashes
   - Input: RMS crashes on the 9th of every month
   - Expected output: System should identify the cause of the crash and propose a solution

3. Enforce co-requisite configuration in Data Access API:
   - Test Case: Check co-requisite configuration
   - Input: Data API request
   - Expected output: System should verify co-requisite compatibility and return an error message if the configuration is not compatible

4. Fix issues with audit endpoints:
   - Test Case: Test audit endpoints
   - Input: Access the audit endpoints
   - Expected output: System should fix the issues with audit endpoints and make them functional

5. Ensure reports reflect timezone based on program settings:
   - Test Case: Check report timezone
   - Input: Generate a report
   - Expected output: The report should reflect the correct timezone and data should be accurate

6. Restrict report delivery to non-corporate email addresses:
   - Test Case: Test report delivery
   - Input: Deliver a report
   - Expected output: System should not send the report to non-corporate email domains and only to approved email addresses

7. Filter audit endpoints by report type ID:
   - Test Case: Filter audit endpoints
   - Input: Filter by report type ID
   - Expected output: The system should filter the audit results accordingly and display only relevant data

Non-Functional Test Cases:

1. Performance Test:
   - Test Case: Test performance under multiple requests
   - Input: Multiple requests to new routes and audit endpoints simultaneously
   - Expected output: System should handle multiple requests efficiently without crashing and within acceptable response time

2. Security Test:
   - Test Case: Test unauthorized access
   - Input: Unauthorized access attempt to audit endpoints
   - Expected output: System should deny unauthorized access

3. Load Test:
   - Test Case: Test system under increased load
   - Input: Gradually increase the number of requests to the maximum limit
   - Expected output: System should handle the increased load without crashing or slowing down significantly

4. Stress Test:
   - Test Case: Test system under stress
   - Input: Exceed the maximum number of requests
   - Expected Output: The system should handle the stress, recover from crashes if they occur and return to normal operation

5. Usability Test:
   - Test Case: Test user interaction
   - Input: User interaction with the system
   - Expected Output: The system should be user-friendly, easy to use and intuitive

6. Compatibility Test:
   - Test Case: Test compatibility
   - Input: Access the system using different devices and browsers
   - Expected Output: The system should be compatible with different devices and browsers

7. Reliability Test:
   - Test Case: Test reliability
   - Input: Continuous operation of the system
   - Expected Output: The system should operate continuously without any critical failures for a specified period of time
