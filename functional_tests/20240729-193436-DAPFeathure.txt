   - Edge Case: Try to rename the channel with a name that already exists

2. Improve Looker dashboard performance
   - Input: Access the Looker dashboard during long running operations
   - Expected Output: The dashboard loads without issues regardless of operation duration
   - Edge Case: Try to load the dashboard with extremely high data-heavy operations

3. Separate Performance from Quality metrics
   - Input: Split the Performance from Quality metrics
   - Expected Output: The metrics are separated and are individually trackable and reportable
   - Edge Case: Try to separate overlapping metrics or dependencies between performance and quality

4. Fix query error for Bottom Geo Performers - L1
   - Input: Execute the query for Bottom Geo Performers - L1 with suppliers
   - Expected Output: The query handles the presence of suppliers without errors and monitoring/filtering works correctly for bottom geo performers
   - Edge Case: Try to execute the query with invalid or missing supplier data

5. Implement LookML generation for overall and share of metrics
   - Input: Use the contract deployment mechanism
   - Expected Output: LookML for overall and share of metrics is generated correctly
   - Edge Case: Try to generate LookML with incorrect or missing parameters

6. Update documentation for AAH
   - Input: Add new changes and features to the AAH documentation
   - Expected Output: The documentation reflects these changes and is clear and understandable
   - Edge Case: Try to update the documentation with invalid or incorrect information

7. Realign industry verticals
   - Input: Perform the realignment of industry verticals
   - Expected Output: The realignment matches current market trends and covers all relevant industry verticals
   - Edge Case: Try to realign the verticals with outdated or irrelevant market trends

8. Optimize Twitter Brand Suitability performance
   - Input: Apply optimizations to the Twitter Brand Suitability feature
   - Expected Output: Load times are reduced and response rates are improved
   - Edge Case: Apply optimizations that could potentially degrade the performance

9. Fix production query errors
   - Input: Review the errors in last month's production queries
   - Expected Output: Fixes are applied and the queries run reliably
   - Edge Case: Try to fix the errors without identifying the root cause

10. Fix issues in AD_SERVER_PLACEMENT_CODE lines 20, 22, 31, 36, 37, 40
    - Input: Review the specified lines of AD_SERVER_PLACEMENT_CODE
    - Expected Output: The logic is fixed and it works as expected
    - Edge Case: Try to fix the code without understanding the logic
